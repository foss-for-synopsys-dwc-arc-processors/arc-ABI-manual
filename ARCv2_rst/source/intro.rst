Introduction
============

The *System V Application Binary Interface* defines a linking interface 
for compiled application programs. The interface is described in two 
parts: 

 - The first part is the generic System V ABI, shared across all 
   processor architectures. 

 - The second part is a processor specific supplement. 
 
This document is the processor specific supplement for use 
with ELF on processor systems based on the ARCv2 instruction-set 
architecture. 

This document is not a complete *System V Application 
Binary Interface Supplement*, because it does not define any OS 
library-interface information. Further, this ABI pertains primarily to 
C and assembly and contains only limited information on C++.

In the ARCv2 architecture, a processor can run in either of two modes: 
big-endian mode or little-endian mode. Programs and (in general) data 
produced by programs that run on an implementation of the big-endian 
interface are not portable to an implementation of the little-endian 
interface, and vice versa. An ARCv2 ABI-conforming system must support 
little-endian byte ordering. Accordingly, the ABI specification defines 
only the little-endian byte-ordering model. The ARCv2 ELF ABI is not the 
same as the preliminary ARC ABI published December 1999â€“April 2010.

.. note::
   This ABI does not specify software installation, media, and formats.

How to Use the System V ABI Supplement   
--------------------------------------

While the generic *System V ABI* is the prime reference document, this 
document contains ARCv2-specific implementation details, some of which 
supersede information in the generic ABI.

As with the System V ABI, this *Supplement* refers to other documents, 
especially the *ARCv2 Programmer's Reference Manual*, all of which should 
be considered part of this *ARCv2 ABI Supplement* and as binding as the 
requirements and data it explicitly includes.

Structure
~~~~~~~~~

This ABI Supplement consists of the following major divisions: 

Chapter 2, :ref:`low_lvl` describes the machine interface, byte ordering, 
data types, storage mapping, function calling sequence, registers, stack 
frame, function prolog and epilog, and function calls and branching.

Chapter 3, :ref:`obj_files` describes the ELF header, special sections, symbol 
table, small-data area, mapping variables to registers, and relocation types 
and fields.

Chapter 4, :ref:`load_link` is of interest to UNIX-style 
operating systems, and describes how programs are loaded and dynamically linked, 
including the global offset table and procedure linkage table. 

Terminology
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. glossary::
   :sorted:

   Callee-saved
      *Callee-saved registers* (sometimes called *non-volatile registers*) hold values 
      that are expected to be preserved across calls. 

   Caller-saved
      *Caller-saved registers* (sometimes called *volatile registers*) hold temporary 
      values that are not expected to be preserved across calls. 

   Word
      Thirty-two bits of data, unless otherwise specified.

Evolution of the ABI Specification
----------------------------------

Each new edition of *System V Application Binary Interface* is likely to 
contain extensions and additions that increases the potential capabilities 
of applications that are written to conform to the ABI.
